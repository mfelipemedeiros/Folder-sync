# Folder sync
When you run the application, it will prompt you for the path to be synchronized, the destination folder for synchronization, the destination folder for logs, and the time period, in minutes, between each synchronization.

Then, you'll have the path that was set to save the logs and the logging in the terminal for each action taken. These logs will be saved in the log file.

This repository includes the challenge for the QA Integration position, which I decided to undertake on my own initiative. Although it was not a mandatory requirement for the position, I found the challenge interesting and chose to pursue it to demonstrate my interest and commitment to the field. Feel free to review the challenge along with the rest of the project. I am available to discuss any aspect of this challenge or the project during the selection process.
